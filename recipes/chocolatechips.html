        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I modified Beatrice's Excellent Oatmeal cookies very slightly.
             I came up with something that my boyfriend went CRAZY over! 
             I've never seen him enjoy cookies to that extent! He said I 
             blew his mother's recipe away.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>    
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter, softened </li>
            <li>1 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar </li>
            <li>2 eggs </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
            <li>3 cups quick-cooking oats </li>
            <li>1 cup chopped walnuts </li>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips </li>
        </ul> 

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown 
                sugar, and white sugar until smooth. Beat in eggs one 
                at a time, then stir in vanilla. Combine the flour, 
                baking soda, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture 
                until just blended. Mix in the quick oats, walnuts, and 
                chocolate chips. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto ungreased
                baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow 
                cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes
                before transferring to a wire rack to cool
                completely.</li>
        </ol>
